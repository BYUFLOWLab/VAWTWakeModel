# VAWT Wake Model Testing

This folder contains various files used for validation of the VAWT wake model.

The wake data used in this validation is from:

Tescione, G., Ragni, D., He, C., Ferreira, C. S., and van Bussel, G., “Near wake flow analysis of a vertical axis wind turbine by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry,” Renewable Energy, Vol. 70, 2014, pp. 47-61.

Battisti, L., Zanne, L., Dell’Anna, S., Dossena, V., Persico, G., and Paradiso, B., “Aerodynamic Measurements on a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine in a Large Scale Wind Tunnel,” Journal of Energy Resources Technology, Vol. 133, September 2011.

Shamsoddin, S., and Porte-Agel, F., “Large eddy simulation of vertical axis wind turbine wakes,” Energies, Vol. 7, 2011, pp. 8990-8912.

The error of the wake model compared to the CFD data is also given the Excel document and the .csv file.
