# VAWT Wake Model Testing

The wake data used in this validation is from:

Tescione, G., Ragni, D., He, C., Ferreira, C. S., and van Bussel, G., “Near wake flow analysis of a vertical axis wind turbine by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry,” Renewable Energy, Vol. 70, 2014, pp. 47-61.

Battisti, L., Zanne, L., Dell’Anna, S., Dossena, V., Persico, G., and Paradiso, B., “Aerodynamic Measurements on a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine in a Large Scale Wind Tunnel,” Journal of Energy Resources Technology, Vol. 133, September 2011.

The error of the wake model compared to the CFD data is also given the Excel document and the .csv file.
