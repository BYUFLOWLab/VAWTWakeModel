# VAWT Wake Model Data

This folder contains the python code used to generate the CFD vorticity database required for the VAWT wake model. The .csv file that contains the current vorticity database is found here, but for future additions, the code can be accessed and used to produce a vorticity database with a larger range of tip-speed ratios, solidities, and other future parameters.

In order to use the files contained here, the CFD vorticity files must be referenced (found in the same folder). All of the CFD vorticity files can be accessed at:
