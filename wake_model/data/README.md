# VAWT Wake Model Data

This folder contains the python code used to generate the CFD vorticity and velocity databases required for the VAWT wake model. The .csv files that contain the current vorticity and velocity databases are found here, but for future additions, the code can be accessed and used to produce vorticity and velocity databases with a larger range of tip-speed ratios, solidities, and other future parameters.

In order to use the files contained here, the CFD vorticity and velocity files must be referenced (found in the same folder). All of the CFD vorticity files can be accessed at:
