# Data Files for VAWT Wake Model

This folder contains the Figshare CFD data and additional data sets used for model error calculations and polynomial surface fitting, the airfoil data used for the power calculations, and the .csv files containing the polynomial surface coefficients used for the VAWT wake model (in the form of loc1,loc2,...; a,a,...; b,b,...; ...).

All of the CFD velocity and vorticity files must be referenced and can be accessed at:
